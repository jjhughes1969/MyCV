        <p>Motivated by working with great people, on cool things; thirty years in financial services, the last fifteen or so in FinTech and payments.</p>
        <p>I've founded businesses, built businesses, attempted to rescue businesses, invested in businesses, transformed businesses, and advised businesses.</p>
        <p>I've been a Chairman, a CEO, a COO, a CFO, and a Founder of technology businesses - and even once (briefly) a CIO.</p>
        <p>And all that time without ever getting really hands-on with technology (except coding in BASIC on my Commodore 64 in the 1980s - but that doesn't really count).</p>
        <p>So here I am learning to code, and finally realising why I could never tear those pesky technologists away from their screens to talk to me about process and deliverables.</p>
        <p>Because it's really addictive.  And I mean, <em>really</em> addictive.</p>

        <h3>CWC Addict</h3>

        <p>A watch collector for many years, a few years back I started a website and blog to document the history of CWC, a watch company started in London in 1972 to supply watches to the British military.</p>
        <p>CWC Addict is the only resource of its kind for collectors of these watches, and publishes an (almost) definitive guide to each type of watch the company has produced, as well as occasional research in to the history of the company and military watches in general.</p>
        <p>I have a website <a href = "https://www.cwcaddict.com/">cwcaddict.com</a> and also an Instagram account <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/cwc_addict/">@cwc_addict</a>.</p>
